        <h1>Learn Promise</h1>
        <h3>A promise represents an asynchronous operation whose result will be come in the future</h3>
        <p>
            The promise constructor takes a function as an argument and that function internally receives resolve - reject as parameters.<br/>
            The resolve - reject parameters are actually functions that we can call depending on the outcome of the asynchronous operation.<br/>
            A promise can go through three states:
                - Pending (when create a promise
                - Fulfilled (when call the resolve function)
                - Rejected (when call reject function) <br/>
            To get the res
        </p>

                setTimeout(function() {
                    const sum = 4 + 5;
                    resolve(sum);
                }, 2000);
            });
